# Cryptocurrencies


# Backgound
We now understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. We are going to put all these skills to work by creating an analysis for a number of clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. 

# Obective
We are creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data to work with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the clients are looking for, we decided to use unsupervised learning. 

To group the cryptocurrencies, we shall use a clustering algorithm and use use data visualizations to share the findings with the board.

# Expected steps
1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results.
